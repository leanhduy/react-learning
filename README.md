## Coding Exercises

### Exercise 1: Accessing DOM Elements

**Objective**: Create a simple form that focuses on an input field when a button is clicked using useRef.

**1. Setup Context**

-   Create a FocusInput component that contains an input field and a button.
-   Use useRef to create a reference to the input field.
-   When the button is clicked, focus the input field.

### Exercise 2: Persisting Values

**Objective**: Create a counter app that maintains the count of how many times a button has been clicked, using `useRef` to persist the count.

**1. Setup Context**

-   Create a PersistentCounter component that contains a button.
-   Use useRef to create a reference to persist the count value.
-   Each time the button is clicked, increment the count and log it to the console.

### Exercise 3: Managing Previous State

**Objective**: Create a component that displays the current value and the previous value of an input field using `useRef`.

**1. Setup Context**

-   Create a PreviousValue component that contains an input field.
-   Use useRef to create a reference to store the previous value of the input field.
-   Display the current and previous values.

### Exercise 4: Controlling Timer

**Objective**: Create a timer app that uses `useRef` to control and clear the timer.

**1. Setup Context**

-   Create a Timer component that contains start and stop buttons.
-   Use useRef to create a reference to store the timer ID.
-   Start the timer when the start button is clicked and stop it when the stop button is clicked.
