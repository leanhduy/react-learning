# React render props
## Definition
- Render Prop is a design pattern in React to share code between components via a prop that is a function which return JSX.
- Render Props is an alternative to Higher Order Component, which is also a design patter that helps achieve better code reusability and reducing repetitive code.
- render prop is a prop passed to a component, whose value is a function that returns JSX.

## Advantages
- The main branch only contains the boilerplate code after running `npx create-react-app`. Nothing special in the main branch
- Each techniques / patterns will be stored as a separated branch and should not be merged into `main` branch
- In each branch the Readme.md file will be updated to match the technique / pattern implemented in that branch
