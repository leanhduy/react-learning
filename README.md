# React Portfolio Project

This repository serves as a showcase of my evolving React.js skills through the development of 10 targeted mini-projects.

**Why a Mini-Project Approach?**

-   **Focus:** Each project tackles specific React concepts for clear skill demonstration.
-   **Adaptability:** Projects cover a range of common web development use cases.
-   **Growth:** Demonstrates progressive learning and development.

## Project List

1. **To-Do List:** Implementing state management, list rendering, and basic data persistence.
2. **Simple Calculator:** Practicing component composition, event handling, and logic.
3. **Recipe Book:** Fetching and displaying data from an external API, image handling.
4. **Weather App:** API interactions, conditional rendering, potential geolocation usage.
5. **Personal Portfolio Page:** Routing, responsive design, and clear information presentation.
6. **Pomodoro Timer:** State management with distinct phases, timer integration.
7. **Basic Clone (Twitter, Instagram, etc.):** Building complex UIs, component breakdown, potential for basic authentication.
8. **Habit Tracker:** Date manipulation, advanced data persistence, potential for visualizations.
9. **E-commerce Product Page (no checkout):** Image handling, data display, styling with CSS frameworks.
10. **Small-Scale Real-time App (chat, drawing):** WebSockets, complex state management (if ambitious).

### Project Status
