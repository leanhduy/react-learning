# React Learning

This repository stores React techniques, patterns I came across while learning Web Development and ReactSJ

**How it is organized?**
- The main branch only contains the boilerplate code after running `npx create-react-app`. Nothing special in the main branch
- Each techniques / patterns will be stored as a separated branch and should not be merged into `main` branch
- In each branch the Readme.md file will be updated to match the technique / pattern implemented in that branch
